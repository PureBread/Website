The Llammigration marketing website is composed of two pages:

*** Media ***
This page is loaded by default when navigating to the site's index. This page prominently features a gameplay video, and also provides a few in-game screenshots and animated gifs below.

*** About ***
This page provides a brief description of Llammigration, along with a short team bio and potraits of each member with links to their contact info.

The site features a visual style intended to emulate that of the in-game graphics. The background implements a parallax effect which moves multiple background layers based on the position of the user's mouse. The font used throughout the site is the same as the in-game font. The navigation menu at the bottom of the site uses the same menu/button style as those in the in-game menus.
Other features include a lightbox for screenshots on the media page, smooth-scrolling, a reasonably fluid layout, page transitions, a link to the game's release page on itch.io (currently a link to SweetHeart Squad's page), and branded team logos on the upper corners of the screen.

The website makes use of three third-party libraries: jquery, and jquery's easing and mousewheel plugins.

NOTE: The website has been tested on all major browsers, but Chrome is preferred, as some features are not available on FireFox and IE.
