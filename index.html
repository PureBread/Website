				<h2>The Game</h2>
				<p>llammigration is a game about leading a herd of llamas on a journey through South America.</p>
				<p>Lead your herd through the journey to a new land safely by managing their resources effectively.</p>
				<img src="images/cano-de-cristales.png"/>
				<p>Llammigration is a game where you must effectively manage their resources to win. This requires planning skills as well as rudimentary mathematics. Although the premise of the game is fictional, you may improve these skills through play and see a benefit in other areas of their life.</p>
				<p>Llammigration takes place in South America. Similar to Oregon Trail, an educational game which inspired the development of Llammigration, you can learn about aspects of South American culture.  Each of the destinations in the game are based on major landmarks or cities which exemplify the diversity of South America. The foodstuffs which the llamas will receive at each destination represent major agricultural exports for the region. The music is heavily inspired by authentic South American music. Other interesting facts about South America also can be found in random events in the game.</p>
				<p>Trade at cities and major landmarks along the way!</p>

				<p>In addition to being educational, Llammigration is suitable for a family audience, specifically targeted at students ages 8-16. The gameplay mechanics are deliberately designed to be as simple as possible: interaction is limited to the UI controls located at the bottom of the screen and multiple choice questions, neither of which require quick reflexes or complex motion. Young children will not find the game overly challenging due to physical constraints, while still providing a suitable mental challenge through the resource-based gameplay. The visual style of Llammigration incorporates bright, cartoony visuals set in fantastic landscapes.</p>
				<h2>The Team</h2>
				<p>llammigration is a game by PureBread, a team of students from carleton university's interactive multimedia and design program.</p>
